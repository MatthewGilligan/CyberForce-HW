# Week2 HW
This week we were to create a short, write up about a security topic and explain to a non-technical audience what occurred, why, and how you’d recommend remediation. The target audience for this write-up is the boss’s boss’s boss (C-suite exec). Additionally, we were assigned to explore TryHackMe and set up a virtual machine to test out concepts. I did the "Windows Basics" and "Network Traffic Basics" modules, as I did not have access to premium. For my write up, I chose to look into the XZ Utils incident. I used the following resources:

## Write-up: 
XZ Utils is an open-source data compression software that is used for Unix-like systems. This source was widely used, and widely trusted, however, in March 2024, after investigating a latency issue, Microsoft engineer Andres Freund discovered that there was a critical vulnerability that would've allowed for backdoor access if it wasn't addressed. This backdoor was to be shipped out throughout multiple files to avoid suspicion and sneak subtle changes through oversight. If implemented, this would've been able to skip verification, so that the attacker (known as Jia Tan) could gain access to the system. They would then have power to remotely execute code, and download their vulnerable software onto various linux distributions, which would allow them to take over any users of these distributions. Victims could include any user, including company systems. 
This was an extremely complex plan that was comprised of many parts, implemented over multiple years, and could not have been possible without the developer of this attempted backdoor gaining the trust of their users. They heavily obscured their attack, placing it in compressed files, and did not post any of the malicious code on their public code publishings. A key takeaway from this incident is that attackers can be anyone, and staying vigilant in code review is incredibly important. Additionally, implementing anti-backdoor techniques, such as a "kill switch", or monitoring ssh activities very closely. In order to prevent attacks like XZ utils from progressing further in the future, we can make sure to scrutinize all code that we implement from any third party.
