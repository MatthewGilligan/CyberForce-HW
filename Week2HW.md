# Week2 HW
This week we were to create a short, write up about a security topic and explain to a non-technical audience what occurred, why, and how you’d recommend remediation. The target audience for this write-up is the boss’s boss’s boss (C-suite exec). Additionally, we were assigned to explore TryHackMe and set up a virtual machine to test out concepts. I did the "Windows Basics" and "Network Traffic Basics" modules, as I did not have access to premium. For my write up, I chose to look into the XZ Utils incident. I used the following resources: 
- https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/04/what-we-know-about-the-xz-utils-backdoor-that-almost-infected-the-world/
