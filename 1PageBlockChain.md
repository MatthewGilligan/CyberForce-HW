# Implementing Block-Chain Technology into Riva's Taco shop to maximize shareholder value

Blockchain technology is a type of online file storing system, that allows a person to prove their digital ownership of some listed product without needing to jeopardize the safety of that product. It can be used to create “digital contracts” that allow for security, privacy and control of a digital good. This blockchain technology is a powerful tool used to not only effectively secure our product, but to improve the customer experience as a whole at Riva's Tacos. In a nutshell, blockchain technology allows for the secure storage of online information in a specific way that is both viewable and accessible, but also unchangeable and safe. Our proposal is to market a series of purchasable NFTs (Non-fungible-tokens) that have value that is closely related to the amount of tacos purchased. Implementing blockchain technology would allow users to own the digital copy of their "go-to order", or the preferred order of a famous celebrity, allowing for a competitive trading scene of NFT-based taco orders. We are optimistic that such an implementation could cause Riva's Taco shop's stock price to rise, and we also expect for an influx of investment capital. Additionally, blockchain, and the web3 technology that it provides are simple and effective ways of guarding our online taco orders. These orders, which we propose to be called "the unchangeables" would be able to be listed and stored online, so that customers can transparently view our menu, and so that investors have additional incentives to purchase a specific taco. Seeing as the value of these "unchangeables" is closely linked to the popularity of their related order, there is a much greater incentive to purchase tacos. 

To summarize, blockchain technology allows for secure ownership of a digital product, and we propose implementing this through our own series of digital taco orders that are related in value to the number of tacos of that type that are purchased.
