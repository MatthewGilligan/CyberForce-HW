# Implementing Block-Chain Technology into Riva's Taco shop to maximize shareholder value

Blockchain technology is a type of online file storing system. This blockchain techology is a powerful tool used to effectively secure not only our product, but the whole of our user experience at Riva's Tacos. In a nutshell, blockchain techology allows for the secure storage of online information in a specific way that is both viewable and accessable, but also unchangable and safe. Our proposal is to market a series of purchasable NFTs (Non-fungible-tokens) that have value that is closely related to the amount of tacos purchased. Implementing blockchain technology would allow users to own the digital copy of their "go-to order", or the preferred order of a famous celebrity, allowing for a competetive trading scene of NFT-based taco orders. We are optimistic that such an implementation could cause Riva's Taco shop's stock price to rise as much as 29%, with a minimum projected increase of 16%. Additionally, blockchain, and the web3 technology that it provides are simple and effective ways of guarding our online taco orders. These orders, the "unchangables" would be able to be listed and stored online, so that customers can transparently view our menu, and so that investors have additional incentive to purchase a specific taco. Seeing as the value of these "unchangables" is closely-linked to the popularity of a their related order, there is a much greater incentive to purchase tacos.
